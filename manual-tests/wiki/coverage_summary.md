## Quality Metrics

### Defect Analysis
- **Total Defects Found**: 1
- **Critical**: 0
- **High**: 0  
- **Medium**: 1
- **Low**: 0

### Test Execution Trends
- **Sprint 1**: 45% test execution rate
- **Average Execution Time**: 15 minutes per test case
- **Automation Coverage**: 30% of functional tests

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
1. **PDF Management** - 0% test coverage completed
2. **Network Resilience** - Limited offline testing
3. **Cross-Platform Consistency** - Insufficient platform comparison

### Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Complete PDF management test execution
2. Expand network connectivity test scenarios
3. Implement cross-platform consistency validation

### Traceability Status
All test cases properly linked to user stories with bidirectional traceability maintained in Azure DevOps work items.

- Total User Stories: **3**
- Manual Test Cases: **7**
- Automated Test Cases: **3**
- Traceability Matrix: ‚úÖ Present (`traceability-matrix.csv`)
- CI Pipeline: ‚úÖ Azure DevOps (`azure-pipelines.yml`)
- Test Results: ‚úÖ Published in `.trx` format with HTML reports
- Code Quality: ‚úÖ Automated linting (Python, Markdown, YAML)

## ‚úÖ Coverage Map

| User Story       | Manual Test Case | Automated | Notes                       |
|------------------|------------------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| US001 ‚Äì Search valid | TC001             | ‚úÖ Yes     | Passed                      |
| US002 ‚Äì Empty query  | TC002             | ‚úÖ Yes     | Validation failed (bug)     |
| US003 ‚Äì Toggle fav   | TC003             | ‚ùå No      | Needs automation support    |

## üîç Observations

- Manual QA coverage covers the core functional flows (search, input validation, state change)
- Automated testing covers the most critical regression cases with API validation
- Azure DevOps pipeline includes comprehensive linting for markdown, Python, and YAML files
- CI/CD produces `.trx` results and HTML reports compatible with Azure Test Plans
- Code quality gates ensure consistent documentation and automation standards
