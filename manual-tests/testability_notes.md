# Testability Feedback Notes

Based on current execution of test cases and review of app behavior:

- ðŸ”¸ **Search field accepts empty input**  
  No validation or warning is shown to prevent an empty search. This makes it hard to confirm if the app is working or simply idle (UX issue).  

- ðŸ”¸ **Favorite toggle has no visual feedback**  
  Tapping the star/favorite icon gives no color change, toast, or confirmation. It's unclear if the action was successful, making it hard to validate manually.

- ðŸ”¸ **Offline behavior is not clearly handled**  
  When the network is disabled, search fails silently or inconsistently. There is no retry strategy, timeout message, or loading indicator for poor connectivity.

These issues affect manual test reliability and suggest areas for improving app observability and testability.
