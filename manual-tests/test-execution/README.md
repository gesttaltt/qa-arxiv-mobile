## âœ… Phase 2: Test Execution & Evidence Collection

### Recording Setup Options

Choose one of these recording methods:

#### Option A: Screen Recording Software
- **Loom** (browser/desktop): Easy sharing and automatic upload
- **OBS Studio**: Professional recording with multiple sources
- **Scrcpy**: For Android devices (computer display)

#### Option B: Device Native Recording
- **Android**: Pull down notification panel â†’ Screen Record
- **iOS**: Control Center â†’ Screen Recording

### Test Execution Protocol

1. **Start Recording** before beginning each test case
2. **State the test case ID** clearly at the beginning
3. **Execute all test steps** methodically
4. **Show results clearly** on screen
5. **Stop recording** and save with descriptive filename

**Filename Convention:**
```
TestCase_[ID]_[Description]_[Platform]_[Result].mp4
```

Example: `TestCase_TC001_SearchValidKeyword_Android_Pass.mp4`

Create this folder structure in your test execution:

```
manual-tests/test-execution/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md (this file)
â”œâ”€â”€ evidence/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ android/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TC001_SearchValid_Android_Pass.mp4
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TC002_EmptyQuery_Android_Pass.mp4

## ðŸŽ¥ Video Upload & Sharing

### Recommended Platforms:
1. **Loom** - Automatic upload, easy sharing, good for quick demos
2. **Google Drive** - Reliable storage, shareable links
3. **YouTube (Unlisted)** - Good video quality, permanent hosting

### Link Generation:
- Ensure links are **publicly accessible** or properly shared
- Test links in incognito mode to verify access
- Use descriptive titles for easy identification

## ðŸ“‹ Execution Checklist

Before marking tests as complete, ensure:

- [ ] Video clearly shows app launch
- [ ] All test steps are visible and executed
- [ ] Results are clearly demonstrated
- [ ] Video quality is sufficient for review
- [ ] Links are working and accessible
- [ ] Test case documentation is updated with results
