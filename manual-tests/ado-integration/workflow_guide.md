## Test Execution Workflow

### Test Run Creation
1. Create test run from test suite
2. Assign to QA engineer
3. Set target completion date
4. Configure test environment
5. Link to sprint backlog item

### Execution Process
1. **Start Test Run** → Update status to "In Progress"
2. **Execute Test Cases** → Record pass/fail with evidence
3. **Log Defects** → Create bug work items with screenshots
4. **Link Defects** → Associate bugs with failed test cases
5. **Complete Run** → Generate execution report

### Defect Management Integration
```

## ADO Wiki Integration

### Test Documentation Structure
```
Wiki Structure:
├── QA Processes
│   ├── Test Case Templates
│   ├── Defect Reporting Guidelines
│   └── Environment Setup
├── Project Documentation
│   ├── Test Coverage Summary
│   ├── Platform Test Matrix
│   └── Sprint Retrospectives
└── Knowledge Base
    ├── Common Issues & Solutions
    ├── Device Compatibility Matrix
    └── Testing Best Practices
```

### Linking Strategy
- Work items linked via #WorkItemID
- Test cases linked via @mention
- Requirements traced via parent-child relationships
- Documentation cross-referenced in descriptions

This structure ensures complete traceability from requirements through test execution to defect resolution, maintaining enterprise-grade QA processes within Azure DevOps.
